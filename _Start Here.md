Welcome to #hist1900c!

You're looking at an Obsidian powered interface on top of a collection ('vault') of text files. Obsidian has *many* plugins and customizations, but at its core, it lets you make note files and find and make links between them. From such a simple mechanic, we end up with a  powerful *emergent* vision of our notes and note making. 

Everything after that is gravy.

You will notice that this is rather similar to the vision of [Vannevar Bush's Memex](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). The value of this vault of notes is that with time you start finding connections you never fathomed. Notes you take for this class suddenly become useful and relevant for another class. And vice versa!  Now, there are many plugins and customizations one could use to enhance your experience; for the time being, we are focussed on *note-making* rather than note-taking, and making valuable interconnections. I've pre-installed just a few basic plugins; don't worry about installing anything else until much, much later in this course. Eventually, when we get to the final stage of the course, you will see how the Journey plugin (which is preinstalled) could be used to instantly pull your materials together into an outline for what could become an essay, an article, a story. But we'll worry about that later. 

Let's not get ahead of ourselves. A good short video to watch to get the basic concept of Obsidian is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88). The interface has changed ever-so-slightly since that video was made, but it'll give you a sense of what this is all about. Watch that first.
